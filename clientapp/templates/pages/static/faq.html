      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>1. What is a pathway?</h3>
      <p>A pathway is a map of Open Badges that leads to a particular goal such as puruing a career or mastering a skill.</p>
      <p>A pathway is a learning map represented by badges, degrees, activities and personal stories.</p>
      <p>These experiences are relevant to where a learner is and where they are headed to. With the Discover project, young people can explore pathways through which they access valued skills and learning experiences. Fully personalized to individuals, pathways can create oppourtunities in specific fields and industries. This project is being developed in conjunction with established professionals, to meet the needs ot employers as well as empowering learners to maximize on their own strengths. A pathway connects the learner to jobs and future learning experiences by building a set of concrete skills.</p>

      <h3>2. What is an open badge?</h3>
      <p>An Open Badge is a digital representation of a skill, learning experience, involvement or achievement. Open Badges let individuals paint a more complete picture of their skills and experiences than tradional forms of accreditation. Since they are granular in nature, Open Badges can be combined through pathways to build up a set of experiences that leads directly onto career opportunities. From the employer's perspective, Open Badges improve the quality and deepen the skill0set within the job market.</p>

      <h3>3. How do Open Badges help people to work toward career opportunities?</h3>
      <p>Many of the most valuable work-place skills and qualities are not measured in tradional educational environments - badges address this issue by representing a fuller range of skill types, including practical industry-specific skills and soft-skills such as teamwork, organization and leadership. This allows individuals to describe their unique qualities and attributes more accurately and gives employers an imporoved toolset for effectively matching candidates to opportunities.</p>
      <p>Young people have incredibly varied strengths and interests, but are not always aware of the opportunities that are out there (and are often not great at planning!). Pathways help to make jobs and careers accessible to young people regardless of their background or existing skill level. This is achieved partly by simply making the learner aware of an opportunity and partly by illustrating the skills and learning experiences required to explore it.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that many careers involve a complex and demanding set of learning experiences - badge pathways make these routes more achievable by breaking them down into smaller chunks. This goal-setting aspect of the Discover project decreases the likelihood of young people feeling that they are incapabe of exploring a particular career pathway, encouraging them to fulfill their potential through a fun, customizable environment.</p>

      <h3>4. Whya are you only covering specific industries?</h3>
      <p>The Discover project is under continuing development - we are exploring how best to help young people put themselves on the pathways that will equip them with the skills and learning experiences expected by employers. To that end, we are currently implementing Discover with a focus on a particular set of idustries - we hope to expand this to facilitate a fuller range of career pathways soon!</p>

      <h3>5. How does pathway work?</h3>
      <p>In the Discover app, learners can explore pathways and make pledges. When logged in, you can see an intuitive indicator of your progress along a pathway, as well as finding new pathways and badges you might be interested in. Since pathways are broken down into individual badges, progress is made clearly visible. Pathways are not prescriptive or fixed, so learners can choose badges freely to explore their interests and demonstrate their strengths. Each young person is unique - pathways reflect that while helping to work toward a particular industry or career type.</p>

      <h3>6. How do I know which badges/pathways to try?</h3>
      <p>Take the quiz! Pathways are designed to be tailored to the individual. Working through the quiz will help you (and Discover) to create pathways that are suited to your strengths and configured to take you where you want to be. The Discover algorithm will calculate personalized recommendations for badges you mght be interested in earning. One of the main aims with the Discover project is that you come across job types or learning experiences you never even knew existed, so explore the available badges!</p>
      <p>You can add badges and pathways you want to pledge and see at a glance which badges you have already earned as well as which ones are outstanding. The interface also shows an intuitive and continually updated representation of how far along a particular pathway the learner is.</p>

      <h3>7. How can I customize a pathway?</h3>
      <p>You can customize a pathway by adding badges you have found and wish to pledge to earn at any time. You can also add notes/storybits to the pathway - this can aid the proess of earning specific badges or hold general information regarding the pathway as a whole. You can also delete notes when you no longer need them.</p>

      <h3>8. How do I know the pathways will help me to access career opportunities?</h3>
      <p>The badges and pathways in the Discover project have been created with the advice of partner professionals in specific industries. While pathways help young people to access careers, they are also aimed at meeting the expectations of employers, so the skills and learning experiences represented in Discover are valued in the workplace. </p>
