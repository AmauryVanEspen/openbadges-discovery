# Neo4j Installation

The project needs access to a Neo4j 2.0 server.

## OSX

As of 2014-03-26 the easiest way to install Neo4j seems to be with homebrew:
`brew install neo4j --devel`. This should install 2.0.0-M06 on your machine.

You can then run the server with `neo4j start`.

## Other OS

If you set the project up on another OS please contribute to this document
with notes and instructions! Indicate an approximate date and any instructions you
followed, tweaks you had to make, suggestions for other users, etc.
